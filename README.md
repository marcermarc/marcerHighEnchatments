# marcerHighEnchants
A possibility to combine enchanted books, tools and weapons in an anvil to higher levels than normal.

Minecraft allows only two combine items in an anvil up too 60 levels. With every combination the costs raise.

**Solution:**

I recommend to combine thus plugin with the MaxRepairCosts Plugin:
